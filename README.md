# Algorithms

My implementation of popular algorithms in Python 3:


**Divide-and-conquer algorithms**

* Randomized QuickSort algorithm (1961) - a commonly used algorithm for sorting with average running time of O(*n* log *n*) . It works by randomly selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. [[Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)] [[Code](./randomized_quick_sort.py)]


**Randomized algorithms**

* Karger's algorithm (1993) - computation of a minimum cut of a connected graph based on the concept of contraction of an edge (v,u) in an undirected graph G=(V,E). [[Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm)] [[Code](./karger.py)]
